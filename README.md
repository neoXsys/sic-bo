sic-bo game container is based on ubuntu 16.04 image. It will generate unique combination of sic-bo game result. We will generate three random numbers from 1-6, resemble DICE and give us unique combination of sic-bo game result.

Basically, it will run /bin/sic.bo.sh shell script. Check source code for better understanding. This script will also redirect output to STDOUT & file located /var/tmp/sic-bo_DATA.txt.

If you want to track all results generated by this container then you use volume feature of Docker while running this container. Below command will mount docker host /var/tmp to container /var/tmp. So, sci-bo.sh will append all results to /var/tmp/sic-bo_DATA.txt, which is available for you locally. Enjoy the game.

Example:

docker run -v /var/tmp/:/var/tmp/ neoxsys/sic-bo
